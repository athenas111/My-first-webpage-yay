# My-first-webpage-yay
    This is a website i coded using basics of CSS, HTML and React. Heavily based on 'GreatStack' react tutorial. It has some responsiveness erros such as
the testimonial in mobile version that i couldnt fix. I'm satisfied since its my first try, of course i'm gonna keep learning and then come back
to this webpage to fix things. 
    The design aint cool cuz i was focusing on practicing react, but i am also taking design classes to improve this. Any help will be apreciated :)
    d i s c l a i m e r : the images used in this webpage are not mine, i took it from pinterest. i dont know how to use github yet i hope i aint
    messing too much lol
